Currently in beta and on the app store. Please email andrew.axtell@gmail.com with any bugs or improvements.

How to use:
This is a pretty straight forward app, but this guide can't hurt.

1. Open the app and click the "Create New Team" button.
2. Type the team name and press "Ok"
3. Now you can enter players. Start with their number, then first name, then last name.
4. If "On active roster" is checked, you will be able to add stats to the player during the next game.
5. All of these categories can be edited later, so if you screw up, it's okay.
6. Continue adding players until you've added everyone you want to add.
7. Press the back button on your phone to return to the main screen.
8. Your new team will appear under "Record New Game For:"
9. Click on the team you want to record a new game for.
10. Type in the opponent name (if you have games previously recorded, you can select one of those)
11. After typing the opponent name, click "Create New Game"
12. A list of players currently listed as "on field" will appear.
13. Tap a player to add a stat to the player
14. Long-press a player name to sub them out. Hint: When someone subs in, they go the position on the list
    that the player subbing out was in. This allows you to organize the player list as you see fit. I usually do
    3 chasers, 1 keeper, 2 beaters, then seeker at the bottom
15. Tap the game clock on the bottom of the screen to start the clock, tap it again to stop the clock.
16. Use the two "Opponent" buttons to record what the opponent does.

If you need more help than that, you can always email me. It's pretty straight forward though.

Using the game clock is not required, nor is tracking your opponents goals. Using the game clock allows you to track minutes for each of your players, if that is important to you. If not, don't worry about the clock.

Recording your opponents goals allows you to track your players' "plus/minus" statistic. A player receieves a "plus" when a goal is scored while they are on the field. A player receives a "minus" if the opposing team scores while they are on the field. This is a useful stat for scrappy players who may not score a lot, and is a key stat for evaluating beaters.

Enjoy
